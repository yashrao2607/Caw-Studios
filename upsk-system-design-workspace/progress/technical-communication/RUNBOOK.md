# OrderFlow Service -- Incident Runbook

**Last verified:** August 18, 2026 by Lead Site Reliability Engineer -- all steps executed and verified against production  
**Last updated:** August 18, 2026  
**Owner:** Platform Payments Team  
**Review cadence:** Monthly, or after any infrastructure/dependency change  
**On-Call Channel:** `#orderflow-oncall` on Slack  
**PagerDuty Escalation:** `OrderFlow Primary` -> `OrderFlow Secondary` -> `Platform Infra On-Call`

---

## Prerequisites
* Access to the production Kubernetes cluster (`kubectl` configured)
* Access to Datadog dashboards (search "OrderFlow" in Dashboards)
* Slack access to `#orderflow-oncall`

---

## Step 1: Verify Service Health

Check the health endpoint:
```bash
curl -s https://orderflow.prod.company.com/health | jq .
```

Expected healthy response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "cache": "connected",
  "worker": "running"
}
```

* If the response is anything other than the above, proceed to **Step 2**.
* If you get no response at all (timeout or connection refused), skip to **Step 6: Complete Service Outage**.

---

## Step 2: Check Application Logs

Pull the last 100 lines of API logs:
```bash
kubectl logs -n production deployment/orderflow-api --tail=100
```

Look for:
* `ConnectionRefusedError` -- database or cache is down (go to **Step 3** or **Step 4**)
* `TimeoutError` -- downstream auth or payment service is slow (go to **Step 5**)
* `500 Internal Server Error` -- application bug or bad deployment (go to **Step 7**)

---

## Step 3: Database Connection Failure

Check if PostgreSQL is reachable:
```bash
kubectl exec -n production deployment/orderflow-api -- \
  python -c "import psycopg2, os; psycopg2.connect(os.environ['DATABASE_URL'])"
```

If the connection fails:
1. **Check the database pod status:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n production -l app=orderflow-db
   ```
2. **If the pod is in `CrashLoopBackOff`, check its logs:**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n production -l app=orderflow-db --tail=50
   ```
3. **If the database pod is healthy but the API cannot connect, verify the environment variable:**
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -n production deployment/orderflow-api -- printenv DATABASE_URL
   ```
   * This should output the PostgreSQL connection string. If it is empty or wrong, the deployment configuration needs updating.

---

## Step 4: Redis / Worker Failure

Check if Redis is reachable:
```bash
kubectl exec -n production deployment/orderflow-api -- \
  redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" ping
```
* **Expected response:** `PONG`

If Redis is not responding:
1. **Check the Redis pod:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n production -l app=orderflow-redis
   ```
2. **If the pod is down, check events:**
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod -n production -l app=orderflow-redis
   ```
3. **Escalate to `#data-eng` if Redis cannot be recovered.**

Check if the Celery worker is processing refunds:
```bash
kubectl logs -n production deployment/orderflow-worker --tail=50
```
Look for:
* `Task received` -- worker is picking up jobs (healthy)
* `Connection refused` to Redis -- worker cannot reach the broker
* No recent log output -- worker may have crashed

If the worker is down:
```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/orderflow-worker -n production
```

**Impact while Redis is down:**
* Rate limiting is disabled. The API will accept all requests, which could cause overload. Consider enabling maintenance mode if traffic is high.
* Refund processing stops. Refunds will queue and process automatically when Redis recovers. No data is lost, but customers will see delays.

## Step 5: Downstream Service Timeout (Auth / Stripe)

Check if the auth service is responding:
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://auth.internal.company.com/health
```

If the auth service is down, OrderFlow cannot validate tokens. Mitigation:
1. Check `#auth-team` in Slack for known incidents.
2. If no known issue, page the Auth team: `pd trigger --service auth-primary`
3. OrderFlow will return `503 Service Unavailable` to authenticated requests until auth recovers. No code action needed on OrderFlow side.

---

## Step 6: Complete Service Outage

If the service is unreachable:
1. **Check pod status:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n production -l app=orderflow-api
   ```
2. **If zero pods are running, check the deployment:**
   ```bash
   kubectl describe deployment -n production orderflow-api
   ```
3. **If pods are stuck in `ImagePullBackOff`, the Docker image is missing or the registry is down. Escalate to `#platform-infra`.**

---

## Step 7: Application Bug / Bad Deployment (500 Errors & Rollback)

If the logs show application errors after a recent deployment:
1. **Check when the last deployment happened:**
   ```bash
   helm history orderflow --namespace production
   ```
2. **If the errors started after the last deployment, roll back to the last stable release:**
   ```bash
   # Reverts deployment to the previous Helm release (does NOT deploy broken latest image)
   helm rollback orderflow --namespace production
   ```
3. **Confirm the rollback succeeded:**
   ```bash
   helm history orderflow --namespace production
   kubectl rollout status deployment/orderflow-api -n production
   ```
4. **Verify the service recovers:**
   ```bash
   curl -s https://orderflow.prod.company.com/health | jq .
   ```

---

## Step 8: Escalation & War Room

If the service is still unhealthy after following the steps above:
1. **Page the OrderFlow secondary on-call:**
   ```bash
   pd trigger --service orderflow-primary
   ```
2. **Post in `#orderflow-oncall` with:**
   * What steps you tried
   * Current error signatures and output
   * Links to Datadog metrics and recent deployment logs

## Known Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Health endpoint returns `"cache": "disconnected"` but API works | Redis pod restarted, connection pool stale | Restart API pods: `kubectl rollout restart deployment/orderflow-api -n production` |
| Refunds stuck in "pending" for > 10 minutes | Celery worker crashed or Redis broker full | Check worker logs, restart worker: `kubectl rollout restart deployment/orderflow-worker -n production` |
| Spike in 429 (rate limit) errors | Rate limit config changed in last deploy | Check `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` env var, rollback if wrong |
| Database connection errors after deploy | Alembic migration failed or was skipped | Check migration status: `kubectl exec -n production deployment/orderflow-api -- alembic current` |
